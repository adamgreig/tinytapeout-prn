# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what

  title:        "GPS C/A PRN Generator"
  description:  "Generate any of the GPS C/A PRN sequences from PRN0 to PRN31"
  how_it_works: "Instantiates the GPS G1 and G2 LFSRs to generate a pseudo-random sequence, then selects the G2 output taps based on the input signals to output the chosen sequence."
  how_to_test:  "Apply clock to the in[0], pulse reset on in[1], choose a PRN between 0 and 31 using in[2:7], then the G1 sequence is emitted on out[0], the G2 sequence on out[1], and the selected PRN on out[2]. The first 20 bits of PRN2 are 11100100001110000011."
